# Buch des Essens

Hello visitor!

I made this project to learn some basic principles of Web Development in Angular and also practice my writing in German! 
Check it here: https://buch-des-essens.firebaseapp.com

I developed using `Stackblitz`, fork the source code there: https://stackblitz.com/github/lauracorssac/buch-des-essens

Thanks to this platform, I could deploy on Firebase with a single tap. 

Judgments are not allowed but feel free to make suggestions and open pull requests!

This project is under development and I am still exploring how to make it better! 

My current To-Do list is:

- Make design better;
    - Adjust title on top bar on small devices;
    - Hide arrows when there is just a single image for a food;
- Add some tags to the recipes and a search by filter! E.g.: sweet, savory, ...;
- Search about accessibility in webpages and implement recommendations found;
- Seach about testing and do it;
