# Buch des Essens

Hello visitor!

I made this project to learn some basic principles of Web Development in Angular and also practice my writing in German!

Judgments are not allowed but feel free to make suggestions and open pull requests!

This project is under development and I am still exploring how to make it better! 

My current To-Do list is:

- Add more photos to a recipe's details;
- Add recipes from other countries as well and do filter buttons to show only those of a selected nationality!
- Search about accessibility in webpages and implement recommendations found;
- Seach about testing and do it;
